simulate RF pad in HFSS

# Each file's role:
- HFSS rf pad. mp4(Chinese) and .srt(English) file is the tutorial I recorded, displaying how to model and simulate a RF-pad in HFSS
- GSG structure.png shows the structure of RF pad, the geometry of the structure is set in exact accordance to the one in Luceda Academy MZM demo
- 1.avi and 2.avi shows 2 propagation mode of the structure (displayed dynamically in a video file)
- Port Zo Plot 1.png and S parameter Chart 1.png is the simulation result of GSG structure
- Smith Chart Intro.pdf gives a brief introduction on the frequently used tool, Smith Chart
- I also attached the source file rf_pad.aedt to the repo, if you have access to HFSS, you can simulate all mentioned part on your local machine.
