0:00:00 --> 0:00:08
In this video, I want to explain how to use Ansys HFSS to RFSPAD.

2
0:00:08 --> 0:00:20
First, we open this software, and it will automatically create a project for us.

3
0:00:20 --> 0:00:23
Then we can change it to RFSPAD.

4
0:00:23 --> 0:00:34
Then we click on Project Insert HFSS Design, and we will get a blank form.

5
0:00:34 --> 0:00:44
Since RFSPAD is running in the interface of the client,

6
0:00:44 --> 0:00:48
it may need some settings in the previous period,

7
0:00:48 --> 0:00:51
but I couldn't write them all down like script.

8
0:00:51 --> 0:01:07
The first step is to choose Modeler, Model Units, and then choose Vimee, UUM.

9
0:01:07 --> 0:01:11
Then we need to change the solution type.

10
0:01:11 --> 0:01:17
For the GSC, the solution type can't be used in Terminal,

11
0:01:17 --> 0:01:20
so we use Model to do the same.

12
0:01:20 --> 0:01:30
After we change the solution type, we may need to scan the parameters.

13
0:01:30 --> 0:01:37
So we need to write the parameters in the previous document.

14
0:01:37 --> 0:01:46
Since this process may be designed in different ways,

15
0:01:46 --> 0:01:52
they may require some parameters.

16
0:01:52 --> 0:01:57
So we can write the parameters in Project Variable.

17
0:01:57 --> 0:01:59
I have already written it.

18
0:01:59 --> 0:02:05
It is made in S.O.I. platform by RFSPAD.

19
0:02:05 --> 0:02:09
So it is the thickness of the machine, the thickness of the computer,

20
0:02:09 --> 0:02:12
and the thickness of the metal board.

21
0:02:13 --> 0:02:19
So for the GSC, it has its own special parameters.

22
0:02:19 --> 0:02:27
For example, what is the size of the pad, the length, and the length of the hardware.

23
0:02:27 --> 0:02:30
The middle part needs some parameters.

24
0:02:30 --> 0:02:32
So I have already written it.

25
0:02:32 --> 0:02:36
Since we are going to make a backup structure here,

26
0:02:36 --> 0:02:47
we need to use a duplicated mirror to make a backup structure.

27
0:02:47 --> 0:02:52
First, we can draw a pattern.

28
0:03:37 --> 0:03:43
We set a 20-veinig width margin here.

29
0:03:43 --> 0:03:48
If you want to change the project variable,

30
0:03:48 --> 0:03:51
you need to add the dollar sign.

31
0:04:07 --> 0:04:15
We can set the value of the design property

32
0:04:15 --> 0:04:18
in the process of naming.

33
0:04:18 --> 0:04:25
We can also set the design property in the process of naming.

34
0:04:25 --> 0:04:29
We can also set the half length.

35
0:04:29 --> 0:04:31
We can do this by doing this.

36
0:04:31 --> 0:04:34
We can set the half length.

37
0:04:34 --> 0:04:37
We can do this by doing this.

38
0:04:37 --> 0:04:42
It is the length of the pad, and the length of the middle part.

39
0:04:42 --> 0:04:46
And the last length.

40
0:05:01 --> 0:05:11
We can set the base.

41
0:05:11 --> 0:05:18
We can set the object to be in control D.

42
0:05:18 --> 0:05:23
We can change it to a suitable map.

43
0:05:23 --> 0:05:30
We can set the size of the GSG.

44
0:05:30 --> 0:05:34
We set the middle line first.

45
0:05:34 --> 0:05:39
We need to use aluminum.

46
0:05:39 --> 0:06:07.820000
We can set the size of the

47
0:06:07.820000 --> 0:06:14.820000
space in the middle.

48
0:06:14.820000 --> 0:06:25.820000
We can set the size of the space in the middle.

49
0:06:25.820000 --> 0:06:31.820000
We can set the size of the space in the middle.

50
0:06:31.820000 --> 0:06:36.820000
We can set the size of the space in the middle.

51
0:06:36.820000 --> 0:06:44.820000
We can set the size of the space in the middle.

52
0:07:01.820000 --> 0:07:19.820000
A smart app willÓ^±Š.

53
0:07:19.820000 --> 0:07:26.820000
In the end, we can migrate the function.

54
0:07:26.820000 --> 0:07:36.820000
We can select the reference point.

55
0:07:36.820000 --> 0:07:53.820000
We can see the position 1 reference is 0000.

56
0:07:53.820000 --> 0:08:00.820000
We can see the result.

57
0:08:00.820000 --> 0:08:07.820000
When the position is 0000, it can be converted to the location.

58
0:08:07.820000 --> 0:08:13.820000
We can change the value to gr.

59
0:08:13.820000 --> 0:08:18.820000
This is the ground on the right.

60
0:08:18.820000 --> 0:08:33.820000
We can define the value at the bottom.

61
0:08:33.820000 --> 0:09:02.820000
We can change the value at the bottom.

62
0:09:02.820000 --> 0:09:29.820000
We can define the value at the top.

63
0:09:29.820000 --> 0:09:39.820000

0:09:39.820000 --> 0:09:53.820000
We can see the gl on the right.

65
0:09:53.820000 --> 0:10:18.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

66
0:10:18.820000 --> 0:10:28.820000
We can use the same function to migrate the function.

67
0:10:28.820000 --> 0:10:39.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

68
0:10:39.820000 --> 0:10:54.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

69
0:10:54.820000 --> 0:11:11.820000
We can use the same function to migrate the function.

70
0:11:11.820000 --> 0:11:26.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

71
0:11:27.820000 --> 0:11:51.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

72
0:11:51.820000 --> 0:12:10.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

73
0:12:10.820000 --> 0:12:24.820000
We can check if the ground is at the top.

74
0:12:24.820000 --> 0:12:39.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

75
0:12:39.820000 --> 0:12:54.820000
We can see the ground on the right.

76
0:12:54.820000 --> 0:13:16.820000

We can change the value of the material to silicon.

119
0:32:00.820000 --> 0:32:01.820000
Let's do it.

120
0:32:04.820000 --> 0:32:06.820000
You can see that it is in.

121
0:32:07.820000 --> 0:32:13.820000
It looks more correct.

122
0:32:14.820000 --> 0:32:22.820000
It is almost the same as the anime.

123
0:32:22.820000 --> 0:32:32.820000
Let me show you how to make a reference scan.

124
0:33:02.820000 --> 0:33:06.820000
It is the same as the reference scan.

125
0:33:09.820000 --> 0:33:11.820000
It looks like a with margin.

126
0:33:11.820000 --> 0:33:13.820000
I will feed it back.

127
0:33:14.820000 --> 0:33:15.820000
I have already made it.

128
0:33:15.820000 --> 0:33:17.820000
I will show you in a few minutes.

129
0:33:17.820000 --> 0:33:20.820000
This is the middle part.

130
0:33:20.820000 --> 0:33:28.820000
When we are here, we can set an add.

131
0:33:29.820000 --> 0:33:37.820000
Let's set up the add.

132
0:33:38.820000 --> 0:33:45.820000
For the scan, we can only scan 5 pn.

133
0:33:45.820000 --> 0:33:48.820000
20g to 24g.

134
0:33:48.820000 --> 0:33:56.820000
We can check the validation first.

135
0:33:57.820000 --> 0:33:58.820000
Analyze all.

136
0:34:05.820000 --> 0:34:07.820000
Let's see.

137
0:34:07.820000 --> 0:34:23.080000
This is the

138
0:34:26.820000 --> 0:34:28.820000
parameter metric.

139
0:34:28.820000 --> 0:34:35.820000
We can change the value of the material to a width.

140
0:34:35.820000 --> 0:34:40.820000
From 4 to 6.

141
0:34:40.820000 --> 0:34:42.820000
This is the value of the material.

142
0:34:42.820000 --> 0:34:45.820000
We can find a free-to-use.

143
0:34:45.820000 --> 0:34:49.820000
Step 1 is the value of the material.

144
0:34:49.820000 --> 0:34:52.820000
We can scan a lot of values.

145
0:34:52.820000 --> 0:34:56.820000
We can scan the pitch.

146
0:34:56.820000 --> 0:35:06.820000
5.6 to 7.2.

147
0:35:06.820000 --> 0:35:10.820000
I want to set a step to 0.4.

148
0:35:10.820000 --> 0:35:11.820000
I will add it.

149
0:35:14.820000 --> 0:35:15.820000
I am sure.

150
0:35:15.820000 --> 0:35:20.820000
I will do a validation check.

151
0:35:20.820000 --> 0:35:27.820000
I can analyze the parameter.

152
0:35:27.820000 --> 0:35:30.820000
I can see 15.

153
0:35:30.820000 --> 0:35:32.820000
I said 3.5, so 15.

154
0:35:32.820000 --> 0:35:34.820000
I will wait.

155
0:35:34.820000 --> 0:35:35.820000
You can see.

156
0:35:35.820000 --> 0:35:37.820000
I will do a validation check.

157
0:35:37.820000 --> 0:35:39.820000
I will do a validation check.

158
0:35:39.820000 --> 0:35:42.820000
I will do a validation check.

159
0:36:42.820000 --> 0:36:45.820000
I will do a validation check.

160
0:39:15.820000 --> 0:39:39.820000
I will do a validation check.

161
0:39:39.820000 --> 0:39:40.820000
Ok, it's done.

162
0:39:40.820000 --> 0:39:43.820000
Now we can do a validation check.

163
0:39:43.820000 --> 0:39:46.820000
Add the tangular.

164
0:39:47.820000 --> 0:39:53.820000
Let's say we want to see the epsilon.

165
0:39:54.820000 --> 0:39:56.820000
I will look at the print.

166
0:39:56.820000 --> 0:39:58.820000
It's symmetrical.

167
0:39:59.820000 --> 0:40:01.820000
Magneto.

168
0:40:03.820000 --> 0:40:05.820000
You can see the 15 lines.

169
0:40:05.820000 --> 0:40:10.820000
This line is a line that you can choose from

170
0:40:10.820000 --> 0:40:13.820000
and use it to make a prediction.

171
0:40:13.820000 --> 0:40:18.820000
This line is a 7.2 and 4.

172
0:40:19.820000 --> 0:40:23.820000
If we want to see this line,

173
0:40:23.820000 --> 0:40:27.820000
we can modify it to 7.2 and 4.

174
0:40:27.820000 --> 0:40:29.820000
Family.

175
0:40:29.820000 --> 0:40:31.820000
I will change it to 7.2.

176
0:40:32.820000 --> 0:40:35.820000
I will change it to 7.2.

177
0:40:35.820000 --> 0:40:37.820000
Plitrace.

178
0:40:37.820000 --> 0:40:39.820000
You can only see this line.

179
0:40:39.820000 --> 0:40:43.820000
If we want to see all the previous lines,

180
0:40:43.820000 --> 0:40:46.820000
we can go back to Plitrace.

181
0:40:46.820000 --> 0:40:49.820000
So when we are here,

182
0:40:49.820000 --> 0:40:52.820000
we can scan the parameters,

183
0:40:52.820000 --> 0:40:54.820000
scan the frequency,

184
0:40:54.820000 --> 0:40:57.820000
and scan the combination of the previous parameters.

185
0:40:57.820000 --> 0:41:03.820000
That's all for today.
